Title: Descrpition of SVG Graphics in Markdown

Author: Gage Smith 

Brief Summary:
For my final project, I have chosen to desrcibe and give examples of various SVG Graphics and explain how they can be used within Markdown.

Targert Audience: 
The indended targert audience of my project is those who are unfamilar and inexperienced with the idea of SVG Graphics. This is not a super in depth tutorial, however I hope that I provide enough information so that afterwards it is not such a foriegn topic to those who are new to this idea.
