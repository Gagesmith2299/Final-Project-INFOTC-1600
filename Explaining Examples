This repository holds three images that were created as SVG files. These can then be easily implemented into HTML files that can then be shown on any modern day Internet Browser!
 
These are easy simple and easy to create, however it shows what can be done with nothing more than a simple text editior and SVG grapihics! My first example is a target that I 
created as a previous project. I use this to show that even when I had only a basic understanding of the concept, I was still able to create a SVG graphic regardless!

My second and third images are a bit more complex. My second images contains multiple shapes that create the image of a house, this uses more shapes than the Target did. 

My third and final image is that of a night sky with some plants growing underneith. Keep in mind that these are in no way that best that can be done! Someone can most certainly
do better than what I created, however these are just examples of what can be created and implemented with SVGs. I hope that these can give inexperienced individules some sort
of directions for that they want to implement!
